Solver timeout: frontend/tests/cases/negative/everyOtherBroken.gr:8:1:
Solver timed out with limit of 10000ms while checking the grading of definition `everyOther` with the following theorem:
∀ {n00 : Nat, n01 : Nat} . (((n01 + 1 = n02 + 1) ∧ (n01 + 1 = n01 + 1) ∧ (n00 + 1 = (n01 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n00 + 1 = n00 + 1)) -> ((1 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1) ∧ ((1 : Nat) + ((n00 + 1) * (1 : Nat)) = (n01 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n02 + 1 = (n01 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n00 + 1 = n02) ∧ (n02 = n00 + 1) ∧ ((0 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1))
You may want to increase the timeout (see --help).
