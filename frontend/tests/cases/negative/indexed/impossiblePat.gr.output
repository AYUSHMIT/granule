Type checking failed: 
Impossible pattern match: frontend/tests/cases/negative/indexed/impossiblePat.gr:6:1:
Pattern match in an equation of `last` is impossible as it implies the unsatisfiable condition (n + 1 = 0)

Counter example: frontend/tests/cases/negative/indexed/impossiblePat.gr:8:1:
  The following constraint associated with `last` is false:
	  ∀ {n0 : Nat} . (((n + 1 = n0 + 1)) -> (n0 = n1 + 1) ∧ ((0 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1))

Counter-example:
  n = 0 :: Integer
