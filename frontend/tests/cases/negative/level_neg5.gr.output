Impossible pattern match: frontend/tests/cases/negative/level_neg5.gr:11:5:
Pattern match in an equation of `case` is impossible as it implies the unsatisfiable condition (Private ⨱ Private) ∧ ((1 : Level) ≤ Private) ∧ (((Private ⨱ Private)) -> (Public * (1 : Level) ≤ Private) ∧ (Public * (1 : Level) ≤ Dunno)) ∧ ((1 : Level) ≤ Private)
