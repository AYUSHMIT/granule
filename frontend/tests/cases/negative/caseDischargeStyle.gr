-- This is an implication of the typing rules on programming
-- style. The following is not well typed, because the binding
-- of 'y' is treated as linear

fooA : forall (a : Type) . (a, a) [1] -> a [1]
fooA [x] =
  case x of
    (y, b) -> [y]

-- On the other hand, this is is well typed:

fooB : forall (a : Type) . (a, a) [1] -> a [1]
fooB x =
  case x of
    [(y, b)] -> [y]
