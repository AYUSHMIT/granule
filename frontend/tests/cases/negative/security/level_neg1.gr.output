Impossible pattern match: frontend/tests/cases/negative/security/level_neg1.gr:17:9:
Pattern match in an equation of `case` is impossible as it implies the unsatisfiable condition (Private * ((Private ∨ (prom_[16:33]0 * (1 : Level))) ∨ (1 : Level)) ≤ Private) ∧ (Private * ((Private ∨ (prom_[16:33]0 * (1 : Level))) ∨ (1 : Level)) ≤ Dunno) ∧ (Public ≤ prom_[16:33]0) ∧ ((1 : Level) ≤ Private)
