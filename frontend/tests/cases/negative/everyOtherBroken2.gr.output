Type checking failed: 
Solver timeout: frontend/tests/cases/negative/everyOtherBroken2.gr:9:1:
Solver timed out with limit of 10000ms while checking the grading of definition `everyOther` with the following theorem:
∀ a2.0 : Type,n0.0 : Nat,t8.0 : Type,t9.0 : Nat,a2.1 : Type,n0.1 : Nat,t8.1 : Type,t9.1 : Nat . ((((0 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1) ∧ (n0.1 + 1 = n0.2 + 1) ∧ (n0.1 + 1 = n0.1 + 1) ∧ (n0.0 + 1 = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0.0 + 1 = n0.0 + 1)) -> ((1 : Interval Nat) ≤ 0..1) ∧ ((1 : Nat) + (n0.2 * (1 : Nat)) = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0.2 + 1 = (n0.1 + 1) + 1) ∧ (n0.2 = n0.2) ∧ (0..1 = 0..1) ∧ (n0.2 = n0.2))
You may want to increase the timeout (see --help).
