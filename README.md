# Gram
A statically typed functional language with graded modal types, including fine-grained coeffect and effect types.
The type system is partly based on the one in ["Combining effects and coeffects via grading" (Gaboardi et al. 2016)](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dao7/publ/combining-effects-and-coeffects-icfp16.pdf).
